# Creating html reports

## Project outline

Write markdown. Then process the Markdown file into a nicely formatted html 
document for distribution.



## Future development ideas

* turn into command line application
* add alternative layouts. currently uses skeleton css
* push generated html documents to central storage location - eg s3, Google 
cloud storage
* make into cloud function. upload markdown to bucket -> function is 
triggered -> generate html document and save in bucket.
* make into flask application
